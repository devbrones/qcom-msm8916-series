i will only port arm-related dts, and only dts related to the h410 platform initially.
Porting the older dts,dtsi will require me to crosscheck all driver dependencies manually which will suck. but it will have to happen.

firstly i will copy the files i KNOW are related to the cf platform (global only for now)
